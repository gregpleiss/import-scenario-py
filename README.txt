This project contains a python script that can be used to import existing features from a feature layer (shapefile or GDB feature class, currently) into a pre-existing Scenario for a Landscape Planner project.  The Scenario must already exist (i.e. this tool will not create a new Scenario for you) and you will need to supply the unique Project and Scenario ID values that will be written to the attributes for the features imported into the Scenario.
